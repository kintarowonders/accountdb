A simple CRM for my business, it just shows who owes me money and multiple ways to contact them

SECUSRVR: By dealing with users by email and the shell, and not using a control
panel, only a hypnotist can hack in. Website: secusrvr.com

This project is not yet complete, the database backend is not yet tested. Just
putting it here so I don't lose it.

What it does is maintains a comma/line seperated database of users and contact
details. It can handle an infinite number of contact types for any user. So I
can store everything from phone numbers, to instant messengers, anything at all.

It also manages billing of customers and stores a timestamp when they are next
due and what kind of service they are using. For example hosting, VPN, VPS, etc.
